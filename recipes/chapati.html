        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are many varieties of chapatis, which originated in the Indian subcontinent, but Kenyan chapatis are in a class of their own. The Kenyan chapati is  a soft, layered, and flaky flatbread with a rich flavor, differing from its Indian counterpart through adapted cooking methods and ingredients. This beloved Kenyan staple is enjoyed throughout East Africa and is often served with stews, curries, or vegetables.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp fine salt</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsps ghee or cooking oil</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of lukewarm water, and a little extra for kneading</li>
            <li>1 extra cup of flour for dusting</li>
            <li>3 tbsp melted ghee or cooking oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 3 cups of flour and add salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Using a wooden spoon, rub in the ghee or cooking oil, then gradually add the lukewarm water, enough to form a firm dough. If the dough is sticky, let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you're using a stand mixer, use a dough hook and let it mix for 10 minutes. If kneading by hand, turn the dough on a well-floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place the dough into a bowl and cover with a kitchen cloth or plastic wrap and set aside for one hour.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 14-16 parts and roll the pieces out into circles.</li>
            <li>Brush the rolled out chapatis with melted ghee or cooking oil and form spiralled balls, then cover and let the oiled dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reroll the oiled dough balls into 15-cm (5-inch) circles.</li>
            <li>Heat a thick-bottomed pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook one chapati at a time, dry frying each side until brown bubbles appear, then brush each side with ghee, flattening the surface with a spoon or flipper until both sides are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process with the rest of the chapatis, cooking each side for 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked chapatis inside a bowl or hotpot lined with a clean kitchen towel or serviettes and cover tightly with a lid. This step will keep your chapatis warm and soft.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favourite <a href="beef-stew.html">stew.</a></li>
