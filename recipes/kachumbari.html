        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kachumbari is a popular, refreshing, uncooked salad from East Africa, especially Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The preparation of this dish varies, but it always consists of a base of fresh, chopped tomatoes and onions, often seasoned with lemon or lime juice and salt. It is enjoyed as a side dish or condiment alongside many East African meals, including grilled meat (nyama choma), pilau, chapati, and ugali.</p>
